"""Tests of the script which writes the version of a release into every file which names one.

What is kept here is that every file which names a version is written, and that what is written is written into the
placeholders a reader copies and nowhere else: a readme which the script does not write is a readme which names the
release before the one being made from the moment that one is made, and a version written where it does not belong is a
readme which says something its author did not.

The script is run against a copy of the files of this repository rather than against the repository itself, so that a
test run leaves the working tree as it was. What is copied is laid out at the paths the script reads by, because those
paths are relative to the directory it is run from.
