"""Write the version which a release is being made of into the files which carry one, or read it back.

A version is named by the tag of the release, and each file which carries one of its own is where its readers find it: a
package of Unity takes its version from the `package.json` which is packed, which is the one OpenUPM reads out of the
tree of the tag as well, and the readme says at which version to install it. So the version has to be in the tree of the
tag before the tag is made, and this is what writes it there:

    python .github/scripts/set-version.py 1.2.3

What the release run asks of it instead is that the tree of the tag names the version of the tag, because a tag which
names a version its own tree does not carry is a release which OpenUPM publishes under the version that tree carries:

    python .github/scripts/set-version.py --check 1.2.3
